Speculating Futures explores past future narratives, like that of Ursula K. Le Guin, and past attempts at technological utopia, like Chile's Cybersyn. In both cases, we will examine what shortcomings prevented these from being fully-realized, how these visions may have been limited or exclusionary, and consider how things are different now. We will tie these to the contemporary technological issues through forward-looking readings like the Xenofeminism manifesto and Inventing the Future. The goal is for students to envision their own utopian futures, which consequently involve reimagining current circumstances, and have them write about and prototype the technologies that undergird these fictions.
