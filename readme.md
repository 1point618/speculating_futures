_Speculative Futures_ explores past speculative narratives, like those of Ursula K. Le Guin, and past attempts at technological utopia, like Chile's Cybersyn. In both cases, these readings examine what shortcomings prevented these from being fully realized, how these visions may have been limited or exclusionary, and tie them to the contemporary issues that need to be addressed in subsequent utopian imaginaries. The goal is to envision our own utopian futures, which consequently involve reimagining current circumstances, and write about and prototype the technologies that undergird them.

This syllabus will probably never be complete; it's always open to suggestions. If you're familiar with GitHub, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request; if not, [feel free to send suggestions to me on Twitter (@frnsys)](https://twitter.com/frnsys).
